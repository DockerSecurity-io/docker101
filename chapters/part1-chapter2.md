# Installing Docker

To get started with Docker, you need to install a Docker runtime on your machine.
The easiest way to do this is by installing Docker Desktop, which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
On Linux, you can also install Docker Engine directly. We will cover both methods below.

## Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is the easiest way to get started with Docker. It includes most of the tools you need to build and run Docker containers.

1. Go to the [Docker Desktop download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
