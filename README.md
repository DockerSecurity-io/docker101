### 📘 What is this book?

**Docker 101: The Open Book** is a practical, community-driven guide to containerization.  
It’s built to help developers go from *zero to containers* — confidently and securely — using real-world workflows and Captain-tested practices.

This book is:
- 🧭 **Beginner-friendly** — start from your first `docker run`.
- 🛠️ **Hands-on** — every concept has examples you can run locally or in Play-with-Docker.
- 🔐 **Security-aware** — naturally leads into [*Docker and Kubernetes Security*](https://dockersecurity.io).
- 🤝 **Collaborative** — open for contributions, translations, and continuous updates.

### 🎯 Mission Statement

> We believe foundational Docker knowledge should be freely available to everyone.
>
> **Docker 101** complements and does not compete with the available commercial books and training.
> It serves as an open, modern prerequisite that prepares readers for deeper learning and for container security best practices.
